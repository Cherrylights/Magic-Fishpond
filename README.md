Magic Fish Pond

Magic Fish Pond is an interactive installation made in Processing by Yikai Zhang. 

Media files are included in the data file.

The required libraries are: LeapMotionP5, Minim and Geomerative. 

For the convenience of users, I have cited the Arduino part. But if you want to use that part you can cite them back.
